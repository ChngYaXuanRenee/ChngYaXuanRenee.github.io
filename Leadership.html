        <p>I was assisting with the research on import channel of Eezee,

            pricing strategies and potential expansions plans! </li>
        <li>Understanding the import channel of Eezee and the business aspects behind it 
            could potentially influence my artistic skills by providing inspiration for my artwork. For instance, 
            I might create art that reflects the intricate logistics of global trade, the diversity of products, 
            or the connections between different industries. Additionally, insights into business strategies and 
            operations could help me develop a more holistic perspective, which might indirectly impact my creative 
            thinking and problem-solving abilities. Art can often draw from various sources of knowledge and 
            experience to create unique and meaningful expressions.</li>

        <h2>Leader representative of my team P1US mobile app pitch in NP X MAPLETREE Hackathon.</h2>
        <h3 style="color: grey;">NP X MAPLETREE</h3>
        <p>I was leading my team of 3 for the study of "People With Visual Disabilities", and my goals were to create
          a brand and design an app called P1US that creates a more inclusive Singapore for PWDs so that 
          they live enriching and meaningful lives.
          </p>
            <br>
        <li>I provide clarity of purpose, motivate and guide my team members the goal of the project.</li>
        <li>Emphatize with my team members' needs and goals too.</li>
        <li>I collaborated with team members from different courses, so that it provides different
          insights and experiences that benefits this project.
        </li>
        <li>Recommendations given from one of my team members in Linkedin - "Collaborating with Renee on the Maple 
          Tree X NP Hack 2023 Hackathon was a pleasure! She took the initiative to kickstart discussions, ensured 
          everyone felt heard, and offered insightful points of her own. She took great care to ensure the timely 
          completion of her delegated tasks. Her meticulously designed prototype blew me away â€” a user-friendly 
          design, practical and comprehensive on its own. Yet, she readily sought feedback. Truly, a teammate who goes above and beyond.</li>
